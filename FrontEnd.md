# Group Students By Section Function

This function is used to group students by their section. It takes an array of student objects, each containing a `Section` property, and returns an object where each key is a section, and the value of each key is an array of students in that section.

## Function Definition

```jsx
const studentsBySection = useMemo(() => {
    const sections = {};
    students.forEach((student) => {
      const section = student.Section;
      if (sections[section]) {
        sections[section].push(student);
      } else {
        sections[section] = [student];
      }
    });
    return sections;
  }, [students]);
```

## Inputs

The function takes an array of student objects as input. Each student object must contain at least the following properties:

| Property  | Type   | Description             |
|-----------|--------|-------------------------|
| Section   | string | The section of the student |

Here's an example of a valid student object:

```jsx
{
  Section: "A",
  Name: "John Doe",
  // ...other properties
}
```

## Output

The function returns an object where each key is a section, and the value of each key is an array of students in that section. Here's an example output:

```jsx
{
  "A": [
    { Section: "A", Name: "John Doe" },
    // ...other students in section "A"
  ],
  "B": [
    { Section: "B", Name: "Jane Doe" },
    // ...other students in section "B"
  ]
}
```

## Usage

This function is used to group students by section, which can be useful if you want to perform operations on students grouped by their section, such as rendering a list of students for each section. You can use the resulting object to easily find all students in a specific section.

# Documentation: Implementing Filtering and Sorting in a Teacher List in React

## Overview

This document outlines how to implement a feature in a React application that fetches a list of teachers, then allows the user to filter and sort that list based on various criteria. This feature makes use of the `useFetchTeachers` hook to fetch the data, and the `useMemo` hook to efficiently filter and sort the data.

## Prerequisites

1. Familiarity with React and React Hooks, specifically `useState` and `useMemo`.
2. The `useFetchTeachers` hook which fetches the data from the API.
3. A table component to display the sorted and filtered list.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Fetch the data

First, we use the `useFetchTeachers` hook to fetch the data. This hook should return an object containing the fetched data and a loading state.

```jsx
const { data: fetchData, loading } = useFetchTeachers();
```

### 2. Render the list

Finally, we pass the `teachers` state to our table component as a prop, and render it.

```jsx
<TableComponent teachers={teachers} />
```

## Dealing with Multi-Data-Type Objects

In some cases, the data returned by your fetch hook may not be in the format you expect. For example, it might be an object with multiple properties, one of which is the array you're interested in.

If this is the case, you'll need to adjust your code to access the correct property. For example, if `fetchData` is an object with a `success` message and an `employee` array, you would use `fetchData.employee` instead of `fetchData`.

```jsx
if (!fetchData || !Array.isArray(fetchData.employee)) return [];

let filteredTeachers = [...fetchData.employee];
```

If you're unsure of the structure of the data you're receiving, you can add a `console.log(fetchData)` in

your fetch hook to inspect the structure of the data.

## Conclusion

Implementing filtering and sorting in a React application involves using hooks to manage state and compute the filtered and sorted list. The `useMemo` hook can significantly improve performance by ensuring that the list is only recomputed when necessary. It's also important to be aware of the structure of the data you're working with, and adjust your code accordingly if it includes multi-data-type objects.

Of course! Here's a step-by-step guide in Markdown format:

# Implementing a Modal in a Next.js (with React) application

## Step 1: Update the ModalD component

First, we update the `ModalD` component to manage its own open/close state based on props and handle the closing of the modal.

```jsx
import { Fragment, useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";
import { Dialog, Transition } from "@headlessui/react";
import { ExclamationTriangleIcon } from "@heroicons/react/outline";

export default function ModalD({ isOpen, onClose }) {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(isOpen);
  const cancelButtonRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    setOpen(isOpen);
  }, [isOpen]);

  const handleClose = () => {
    if (onClose) {
      onClose();
    }
    setOpen(false);
  };

  return (
    <Transition.Root show={open} as={Fragment}>
      <Dialog
        as="div"
        className="fixed inset-0 overflow-y-auto"
        initialFocus={cancelButtonRef}
        onClose={handleClose}
      >
        {/* Rest of your ModalD code */}
      </Dialog>
    </Transition.Root>
  );
}
```

## Step 2: Update the TList component

Next, we'll add state to the `TList` component to handle opening and closing of the `ModalD`. In the button that triggers the modal, we set an `onClick` handler to open the modal. We also render the `ModalD` component and pass it the `isOpen` and `onClose` props.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import ModalD from "../../components/Modals/DeactivationModal";
// ... other imports ...

function TList() {
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);

  const handleOpenModal = () => {
    setIsModalOpen(true);
  };

  const handleCloseModal = () => {
    setIsModalOpen(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your table code... */}
      <td className="relative whitespace-nowrap py-4 pl-3 pr-4 text-right text-sm font-medium sm:pr-0">
        <button
          onClick={handleOpenModal}
          className="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-900"
        >
          Edit<span className="sr-only">, {person.name}</span>
        </button>
      </td>
      {/* ... rest of your table code */}
      
      {/* Add your ModalD here, and pass the required props */}
      <ModalD isOpen={isModalOpen} onClose={handleCloseModal} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default TList;
```

And that's it! Now, when you click on the "Edit" button, the `ModalD` should open. Clicking on the Deactivate or Cancel button in the modal should close

### 1. In the `TList` component

We set up a state to control whether the modal is open and another state to keep track of the currently selected person.

```jsx
const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [currentPerson, setCurrentPerson] = useState(null);
```

We then defined two functions, `handleOpenModal` and `handleCloseModal`, to handle the opening and closing of the modal.

```jsx
const handleOpenModal = (person) => {
  setCurrentPerson(person);
  setIsModalOpen(true);
};

const handleCloseModal = () => {
  setIsModalOpen(false);
  setCurrentPerson(null);
};
```

Finally, in the render of `TList`, we added a button for each person with an `onClick` that calls `handleOpenModal(person)`.

```jsx
<button
  onClick={() => handleOpenModal(person)}
  className="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-900"
>
  Edit<span className="sr-only">, {person.name}</span>
</button>
```

We also render the `ModalD` component, passing the `isOpen`, `onClose`, and `person` props.

```jsx
<ModalD
  isOpen={isModalOpen}
  onClose={handleCloseModal}
  person={currentPerson}
/>
```

### 2. In the `ModalD` component:

We set up a state to mirror the `isOpen` prop passed from the parent component. We also set up another state to hold the details of the person passed from the parent component.

```jsx
const [open, setOpen] = useState(isOpen);
const [currentPerson, setCurrentPerson] = useState(person);
```

We added a `useRef` to prevent the `useEffect` from running on the first render.

```jsx
const isFirstRender = useRef(true);
```

Then we added two `useEffect` hooks. The first one syncs the local `open` state with the `isOpen` prop. The second one syncs the local `currentPerson` state with the `person` prop.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (isFirstRender.current) {
    isFirstRender.current = false;
    return;
  }

  setOpen(isOpen);
}, [isOpen]);

useEffect(() => {
  setCurrentPerson(person);
}, [person]);
```

With this setup, the modal can now open and close correctly and always has the correct data for the currently selected person.
